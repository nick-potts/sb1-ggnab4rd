      question: "How does Kin work?",
      answer: "We match 5-6 people based on shared interests or conversation topics. You'll receive a confirmation with the time and location details on Saturday. Simply show up, enjoy your coffee, and connect with new people."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a fee to participate?",
      answer: "Yes, there's a small fee of $19.99 per meetup to cover administrative costs. The cost of your coffee (and food) is paid directly at the cafe."
    },
    {
      question: "How are groups matched?",
      answer: "Our algorithm matches participants based on interests, conversation preferences, and occasionally diverse backgrounds to create engaging discussions. We aim for a balance of commonality and diversity."
    },
    {
      question: "Where do the meetups take place?",
      answer: "Kin's are held at partner caf√©s throughout the world. When you book, you'll see available locations near you, and can choose the most convenient option."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I can't make it after booking?",
      answer: "Please cancel at least 24 hours in advance so we can adjust the groups. You will be provided with a full refund."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do the coffee meetups last?",
      answer: "Meetups typically last 1-1.5 hours, though you're welcome to stay longer if your group is enjoying the conversation. We find this is the perfect amount of time for meaningful connections without overwhelming new participants."
